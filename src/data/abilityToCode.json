You can do the following actions with the plates:\n\t\t● Put a plate on the pile: Add a plate to the top of the pile.\n\t\t● Take a plate off the pile: Remove the plate from the top of the pile.\n\t\t● Check the top plate: See which plate is on top of the pile (the plate that you would remove if you took one off).\n\t\t● Check if the pile is empty: See if there are any plates on the table.\nThe pile of plates works like a stack of dishes at a buffet — you always add and remove plates from the top.\n\nInitial Condition: The pile of plates starts empty.\n\nCommands:\n\t\t1. Put a plate on the pile (color: Red)\n\t\t2. Put a plate on the pile (color: Blue)\n\t\t3. Check the top plate\n\t\t4. Put a plate on the pile (color: Green)\n\t\t5. Take a plate off the pile\n\t\t6. Check the top plate\n\nAfter the 3rd command (Check the top plate), what color is the top plate?",
